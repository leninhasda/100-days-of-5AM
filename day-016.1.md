# Day 016.1

at 8:45am.

Ahhh... I hate it, but I am becoming lazy again. This is the second time. I can't even continue for straight 20 days.

Ok let's divide and conquer, instead of next 100 days lets just focus on this week. I am gonna see through this week and when I do that I will worry about the rest.

Tomorrow it is.
