# Day 016.2

at 5:45am.

I am quite late today as well, but I am accepting the time as well, you know for motivation purpose and stuff. As I was late i didn't go out for walk, but surprisingly spend the day... I would say a bit productive!

After several months I finally finished the book "Working effectively with legacy code" and it felt good to finish such an awesome book. Its a must read for every developers.

Another thing I did today is that I progressed Django learning about 20%. Now I can touch any Django project with confident. Thought I am not sure about deployment of Django app on production server, but I am looking forward to learn it as well. So far I have learned basic app creation, migration, templting, url management. And with these knowledge I am thinking of contributing on pybd.org project on github. Actually I already did some contribution there and looking forward to do more =D
