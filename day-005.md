# Day 005

Rise and shine, on time again. 

There is this weird thing happening. It's my previous habit that when ever i really need to do something i used set alarms, well not just one. A dozon of them. So i did the same, i set 10 alarm on every 10 minutes to wake me up in the morning. But i am waking up within the first 3 alarms. So basically rest of the alarms are not needed. But i don't also want to delete them, i want to keep them just in case.
So i have two choises right now, first is that after waking up i manually go through rest of all the alarms and disable them for today. The catch is i have to enable them again for tomorrow! And the second is that i wait for alarm to run and each time they run, turn them off.

Ahhhh... both of them seems boring to me. I think i will be needing a customized alarm for me!!
