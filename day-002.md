# Day 2

On time. Did few freehand exercise, then went for a walk. Today I walked for about 44 minutes. I am hoping to start running from tomorrow.

Not quite sure why but i had to take a power knap of about 1.30 hours (power knop huh..!!), I think it is because of previous habit. I will get try to get over that part too.
