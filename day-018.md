# Day 018

at 5:00am.

This is day 2 of target 10th days. Yesterday I went to outside around 5:40am, and it was still early morning. There wasn't many poeple, and it felt just the perfect time for a run. So today I tried that again. Just a little bit earlier than that, at 5:30am. And it was peacefull. I hope to do it again tomorrow.
