# Day 008

at 5:10am.

Today I felt like hell waking up in the morning. Every part of my body was telling me, "what does it matter if I take a day leave. I will continue from tomorrow again"
. And suddenly there was other part telling me, if I can't wake me up only for 100 days I might not be able to some other things that I am planning to do in life. So I pull my lazzy ass out of my bed, did my regular 'things' but went for running a little early. This is something a friend of mine told me yesterday, and I am planning to go early tomorrow as well.

Despite being lazy at the morning, the day went really well. I haven't slept the whole day. And although it was weekend and I was planning to spend weekend as ... well you know weekend, the day was productive. I read a lot, reduce the size of browser tabs, and yes launched 'the site'. Today was my first day working with aws server, and it went well. The site is up and running and I will be adding more contents as soon as i can.

Ohh.. one more thing, I decided to put the wake up time in the log :)
