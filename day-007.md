# Day 007

Today was the worst! Not only I woke up late (at 5:40am) but I didn't any of the schedule and ended up doing I should not have.
Yes I slept during the day. I did however manage to wake me up in the evening. I need to figure out few thing that would keep me wake. 

I already have 10P theory which doesn't always work, so may be I will try going out door if I get sleepy.
Yeah, lets try that!
