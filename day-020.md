# Day 020

at 5:10am.

This is day 4th of target 10th days.

Ok I need to stop doing this. I always forget to write this log. From next time I will write log at 10PM, actually before 10PM. Yes, yesterday I woke up at time and went running. Further more I cycled about 10 KM.. and guess what my max speed was 32Km/h!!! Although average was under 15km/h. I will continue cycling as often as i can.
