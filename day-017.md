# Day 017

In case someone didn't notice, i skipped last four days from 28th to 31th of March'17. I just felt like I don't want to continue anymore.. of no particular reason. And then the 1st of April arrived, and suddenly I was at peak to do it again. So here am I, got up morning and went outside for a run. Not only that, in the evening I also cycled for about 12KM!

Well my last thought is that maybe I should take inbetweens. I am still not sure how many days should I continue until I take a break. From previous experience it was about 2 weeks, after that I lost interest. So lets see if I can continue for about 10 days, if I manage to do that will take a break of 1 day and continue again!
