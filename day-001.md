# Day 001

Successfully got up at time. It did took me to push myself, because I have become too lazy after spending 2 months of total laziness.

Main motivation of this challenge was actually because I had wake up early yesterday, I had my masters final presentation and I was too excited that I could not sleep well the night before. Then in the morning suddenly it occurred, if I can do It today why can’t I do it every day?

So here I am, but instead of every day I am starting with 100 day. If it goes well I may extend it to every day ( or not cause I am lazy :p ).

One more reason it I am trying to change “motivational work” to “consistent work”, and I want to believe that if I can do this challenge consistently for 100 days, I can apply the same on every other part of my life.
