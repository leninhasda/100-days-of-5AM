# Day 014.1

at 12:45am, at 2:25am, at 3:45am, at 5:40am, and finally at 8:30am.

Speaking of bad day, I am putting today as version 1 of 14th day. From the above list you can already see that I had sleepless night, and I am still searching for the reason!!!
Anyway, I am hoping to continue, and everytime I make mistake I will versionize them o.O!
