# Day 4

Yesterday I went to sleep a little late cause I hade to attend somewhere and was late, but I managed to got up on time.

And guess what today I run. After a really long time today I run, although it was only for 10-12 minutes. But it felt good, so I bought a pair of shoes =D

I am gonna run tomorrow again.
